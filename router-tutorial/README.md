# Swirl Cocktails

A simple site to show the concept of routing of components in React using react-router-dom.

### Things needed to setup the project:

- create folder using npx create-react-app app_name
- npm install react-router-dom

Router, Switch, Route, Link are the components that will be used from react-router-dom

Router: Wraps the app to give the routing functionality

Swtich: Works pretty much like switch case only.The path that is staisfied by the url is executed.

Route: specifies which component needs to be rendered for the specific path

Link: Adds the link i.e `<a></a>` tag to the component and sends the request to the mentioned path
