# Tic Tac Toe

This game is build using the tutorial given in the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

I build this game using both the Class component and Functional Component. This will make it clear how they are different.

Concepts shown in this project:

- Functional and Class component
- Passing of props and using state variables to control the game logic
- Lifting up of the state
- Updating state variable using setState()
- Immutable nature of state variables

All of these functionalities are also added to the game. Implementing them will make us understand how state variables are manipulated and passed down as props to perform the right logic.
