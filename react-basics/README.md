# React Basics

React project folder can be created using `npx create-react-app app_name`

For this to work you need nodejs to be installed in your local machine.

React is a javascript library that helps in building frontend.

[React documentation](https://reactjs.org/)

The advantage of React over vanilla javascript is the fast rendering of the DOM. This due to fact that it wraps all the html and javascript code together to form components. These components are the building block of web page in React world.

Concept covered in this repo:

- Functional Components <br>
  [There are two types : Class and functional but in this repo functional is used as it is usually preferred]
- Props and states
- useState
- Destructing concept [ES6 feature]
- Arrow function
- Map function to create list of elements of similar nature
- JSX to return HTML code from component to render it on DOM

Remember the state variables used in components are immutable in nature hence you need to use setState API of React to change their value.
